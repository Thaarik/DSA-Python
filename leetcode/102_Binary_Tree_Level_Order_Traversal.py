Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # do this with BFS Approach (queue). First add the root inside the queue. Then for each node, pop the first elemnt of that queue, add its left and right child into that queue and add it inside the level array until the queue becomes empty.
        queue = []
        result=[]
        queue.append(root)
        while queue:
            level = []
            for i in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.pop(0)
                if node:
                    level.append(node.val)
                    queue.append(node.left)
                    queue.append(node.right)
            if level:
                result.append(level)
        return result
